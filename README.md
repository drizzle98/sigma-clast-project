## Current progress
Models:   
Transfer leaning model  
YOLO model

Visualization:  
Automatic Detection and Classification of Rock Microstructures through Machine Learning
  
All of the models and visualization are in notebooks folders. Please see the instruction below to use.

## Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/drizzle98/sigma-clast-project
```
Go to your cloned directory
```bash
cd ../github/sigma-clast-project
```
Install the required packages
Using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Using conda:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
```bash
conda activate microstructures
```
Go to notebook folder:
```bash
cd notebooks
```
Run Jupyter lab:
```bash
jupyter lab
```
